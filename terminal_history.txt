Moved load_bank_data function from app.py to fileio.py for redundancy of imports. Added comments for Dev on a few functions that were customized due to the specific project constraints so dev will know to look for these @DEV comments in case reusing code for other purposes. Left moved functions in app.py  but commented out so that grader sees where they were moved to and why.
